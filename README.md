# Shitty Crypto
The weak, broken, shitty encryption library. All algorithms have been created to demonstrate to first year engineering students how bad trying to write your own cryptography is. It also includes a tool that will trivially break and reverse all the provided encryption algorithms. 

Don't roll your own crypto.
